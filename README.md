## Preview

## Tech used
* React DND
* Browserify
* Babel

## Tech Not Used
* Any specific implementation of Flux
  * It's just not needed. Event-orientation can be achieved natively in most platforms. Node.js's EventEmitter is especially adept at this but NSNotificationCenter on iOS and others are also well-suited. 
* Gulp, Grunt or other build tool
  * I *love* Gulp but it's just unnecessary for this small project
  
## You don't have tests yet
* That's true
